# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The aim of the project was to select one of the datasets provided by Lighthouse Labs and utilize Tableau to build visualizations that analyze the changes in the leading causes of death from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, the project aimed to identify patterns regarding the leading cause of death in different countries. Furthermore, the project sought to forecast the five leading causes of death based on the available data. The dataset chosen for this analysis was sourced from the Global Burden of Disease, a comprehensive global study published in the medical journal The Lancet, which focuses on the causes of death and disease. The project intended to leverage the learned concepts and techniques from the course to create insightful visual representations of these trends, clusters, and forecasts.

## Process

1. Connected the CSV dataset to Tableau.
2. Checked the data types of the columns in the dataset.
3. Changed the data type and renamed the column for the Country to ensure consistency and clarity.
4. Created a couple of basic visualizations to explore and gain insights from the dataset.
5. Renamed the "Neoplasms" column to "Cancers" to make it more understandable for a general audience. 
6. Applied SQL queries to remove non-country entities (such as America, Macau, and Zaire) from the analysis.
7. Developed visualizations to analyze and compare the leading causes of death from 1990 to 2019, examining if there were any significant changes over time.
8. Designed a comprehensive dashboard to present the visualizations and insights from the analysis.

## Results

For this Tableau project, the dataset selected was **Causes of Death - Our World In Data**. The project focused on exploring the changes in the leading causes of death from 1990 to 2019 and analyzing differences between countries, continents, and potential future trends.

By utilizing line graphs, bar charts, and maps, the project addressed the following data questions:

- **Change in Leading Causes of Death**: The visualizations have not revealed notable shifts in the top 10 leading causes of death over the 1990-2019 period.

- **Variations between Countries**: The analysis highlighted variations in the leading cause of death across different countries. This indicated the influence of various factors such as demographics, healthcare systems, and socio-economic conditions.

- **Clusters of Countries**: Exploring clusters of countries with similar leading causes of death provided insights into potential regional patterns and shared risk factors contributing to specific causes.

- **Future Trends**: While the dataset did not include population size, the project utilized available data to explore potential future trends. By analyzing historical patterns, the project aimed to forecast potential changes in the top five leading causes of death in the coming years.

Overall, the visualizations and analysis in Tableau provided valuable insights into the changing landscape of causes of death, variations between countries, and potential future trends. These findings contribute to a better understanding of global health patterns and can inform policy decisions and interventions aimed at reducing the burden of specific causes of death.

## Challenges 
The project encountered several challenges throughout its implementation. With 33 different causes of death, 20 years of data, and 211 countries, selecting specific aspects for analysis was a complex task due to the abundance of potentially interesting insights. The absence of population size data in the dataset posed a limitation, preventing a direct comparison between countries beyond calculating the percentage of deaths by cause. As a result, it was not possible to calculate the number of deaths per capita, which could have provided valuable additional information. Despite these challenges, the project sought to make the most of the available data and leverage other relevant variables to gain meaningful insights.

## Future Goals

In addition to the current progress, the project aims to incorporate demographic data, including country population, age, and sex, as well as financial variables, such as GDP per capita. The goal is to explore potential correlations between these factors and the leading causes of death. By integrating these additional variables into the analysis, we aim to gain insights into potential relationships and better understand the impact of demographics and financial factors on causes of death. These future goals will enhance the depth and comprehensiveness of the project, providing a more holistic understanding of the underlying dynamics.
